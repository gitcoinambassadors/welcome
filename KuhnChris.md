#Hi There!

... as you can see, I suck at writing Markdown files by hand.

My name is Chris, I have been working on- and off with and for GitCoin since 2018.

Competencies I bring on board include (but not limited to):
- Project Coordination
- Development (Python, Javascript, C#, PHP, SQL, you name it.)

I started on the ambassador team wave 0 under Ryan's leadership, took a short break at the start of 2019 after changing my real life job, and rejoined the ambassador team at mid-2019.

Things I achived/created during my ambassador time:
- Bufficorn Event Page on Gitcoin.co
- various small fixes on OSS projects
- learned how to handle web3 on python and javascript

If you got any questions - feel free to ask me over at Discord or at Gitcoin Community Slack.
