## Steven Hatzakis

Hi Everyone, 

I'm Steven Hatzakis, great to be here and part of the Gitcoin Ambassador program. 

I've been working in financial services since 1998 and am a full time financial technology reseracher and writer encompassing UI/UX for consumer financial products, and trusted authority for online brokerage reviews that are read by millions of people, more about me here:

I first wrote about cryptocurrencies in 2013 (about arbitrage and market inefficiencies), which was around the time I mined Bitcoin using a PC as a novelty.

Just a few year's ago I started to experiment with computer programming and it developed into an exciting adventure.

I'm passionate about building applications that empower users to be more self-reliant and take control of their own cybersecurity, including the use of cryptography and cryptocurrencies. 
Areas of interest include low-level code (machine readable binary, dealing with bytes, etc..), compression alogirthms, notataion schemes, encryption algorithms, hash functions and new innovations in cryptography applicable to consumers and commerce.

### Dev Skills

-	Have installed Linux (Ubuntu, Kali) and Windows (various) operating systems 
-	Intermediate use of terminal/command line
-	Configured routers, website hosting (DNS, cloudflare), firewalls, VPNs, etc..
-	Served websites locally via Django and using local host via Python
-	Run IPFS nodes and hosted IPFS files
-	Run a full Ethereum node in 2017 via Gist
-	Compute an Ethereum address (public-private key pair and address) through the use of ECC via curve secp256k1 in Python. 
-	Can generate local RSA keys using SSH via the command line
-	Fluent with manipulating bits (shift rotation, flipping, inverting, reversing, endianness) and converting from hex, strings, integers and float precision in Python and the use of Scipy, Numpy and other custom Python libraries. 
-	Intermediate experience working with the conversion of btyes and btyearrays. 
-	Can compute arbitrarily-long triangular numbers at will. 
-	Intermediate understanding of polynomial equations and their relation to number fields related to elliptic curve math and coordinates.
-	Fluent in the use of logical XOR and XOR’ing bits of arbitrary length and format. Have computed linear s-boxes, map of distinct XOR terms for a given range, and Caley XOR Tables.
-	Have run python programs at command line (terminal on Mac and on Windows) and using Python Shell in the default IDLE interpreter.
-	Can mathematically concatenate and de-concatenate large integers programmatically. 
-	Have computed 4-million bit-long deterministic binary numbers, using an expansion (stretching algorithm that I developed from scratch). 
-	Intermediate understanding and experience with use of Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme
-	Fluent in building cryptographically secure password generators using existing cryptography primitives in Python and arbitrary libraries using existing valid characters (i.e. ASCII, UTF-16) to achieve a desired maximum level of entropy for a given constraint on password/library length.
-	Intermediate-advanced experience with the One-time-pad and ability to compute the potential ciphertext space from and arbitrary message space and keyspace, as well as distinct XOR terms and inputs, including duplicates.
-	Can Hash certain file formats using modern hash algorithms (SHA256, Keccak512, etc..)
-	Can hash arbitrary binary data formatted as binary string or bytearray
-	Fluent in ability to calculate potential entropy from a known key space and password length.
-	Able to divide and multiply arbitrary numbers with the use of modulo arithmetic including devmod in Python.  
-	Able to create a cryptographically secure random palindromic binary string of arbitrary length.
-	Fluent with generating random numbers via the command line or writing a new program to execute such commands, using industry standards in terms of cryptographically-secure libraries. 



### Contributions and Creations

I am a contributor on Github to the [Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) Cryptography API](https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/graphs/contributors), and to advanced functions found in [Ian Coleman's BIP39 Mnemmonic Tool](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/graphs/contributors), anda few other repositories. 
I'm the inventor of [Palindromic Mnemonics (Reversible Recovery Phrases)](https://bcaventures.com/reversible-mnemonic.html) that are BIP39-compliant in terms of checksum. I've also developed a notation scheme called Hatnotation, during a Gitcoin Hackathon.  I program primarily in Python and have some experience with Javascript, and have compilted programs in C++ as well as Java.

I lead the Blockchain Expert Committee (BEC) for [BlockchainAssociation.io](https://blockchainassociation.io/), an alternative dispute resolution organization that is member-based and backed by FinancialCommission.org.

I've advised a [dozen startups](https://stevenhatzakis.com/portfolio-2/) and have developed math formulas related to crypteconomic systems in terms of game-theory and Metcalfe's Law. 



### Art and Other Hobbies

I'm also passionate about Art, including digital art and using Math when creating various Artwork, and my paintings have sold in NY art galleries and to private collectors. 

When not behind a computer I enjoy watersports including freediving and spearfishing, as well as hiking, camping, and travel.
